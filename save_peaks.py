    #find_peaks(x, height=None, threshold=None, distance=None, prominence=None, width=None, wlen=None, rel_height=0.5, plateau_size=None)
        #x (sequence): A signal with peaks.
        #height (number or ndarray or sequence, optional): Required height of peaks. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required height.
        #threshold (number or ndarray or sequence, optional): Required threshold of peaks. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required threshold.
        #distance (number, optional): Required minimal horizontal distance between neighboring peaks. The distance is measured in number of samples.
        #prominence (number or ndarray or sequence, optional): Required prominence of peaks. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required prominence.
        #width (number or ndarray or sequence, optional): Required width of peaks. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required width.
        #wlen (int, optional): Window length used for the computation of the prominence. If None, the window length is set to the size of the input signal.
        #rel_height (float, optional): Used for calculation of the peaks width, thus it is only used if width is given. See argument rel_height in peak_widths for a full description of its effects.
        #plateau_size (number or ndarray or sequence, optional): Required size of the plateau. Either a number, None, an array matching x or a 2-element sequence of the former. The first element is always interpreted as the minimal and the second, if supplied, as the maximal required size.
    #Returns:
        #peaks (ndarray): Indices of the peaks in x. The length of peaks is equal to the number of peaks found.
        #properties (dict): A dictionary of properties of the peaks. The keys are the names of the properties and the values are arrays of the same length as peaks. The properties are:
            #'peak_heights': If height is given, the height of each peak in x.
            #'left_threshold','right_threshold': If threshold is given, these keys contain a peaks vertical distance to its neighbouring samples.
            #'prominences', 'right_bases', 'left_bases': If prominence is given, these keys are accessible. See peak_prominences for a description of their content.
            #'widths', 'width_heights', 'left_ips', 'right_ips': If width is given, these keys are accessible. See peak_widths for a description of their content.
            #'plateau_sizes', 'left_edges', 'right_edges': If plateau_size is given, these keys are accessible and contain the indices of a peakâ€™s edges (edges are still part of the plateau) and the calculated plateau sizes.
